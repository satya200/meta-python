1. location where python.exe is present (root path)

C:\Users\Kiran\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39

Python (scripting tool)
-----------------------
1. Interpreted technology
2. loosely typed data
   implicitly
   ----------
   i = 20    
	

Explicitly
----------
int i;
i = 10;


a. Numbers
   integers => 1, 2, 10, 50
   real => 2.5, 9.7,  89.5
   complex => 2+4j
   long

b. strings => stored like arrays
   strings are immutable 
   
c. boolean

1. Lists
   same as arrays
   collection of hetrogenous data
   memory allocation is continous

   Deep copy
   l2 = l1.copy()
   l2 => seperate memory
   l1 => seperate memory

   will not work with two dimensional array
 
   for two dimensional arrays we make use of copy.deepcopy() method which is imported from copy module

 
   Shallow copy
   l2 = l1
   both are sharing the same memory



2. Dictionaries - Associative arrays

d = k1: v1, k2: v2, k3: v3.....
all keys in a dictionary is unique

3. Tuple - immutable list

tuples are immutable


4. sets

range(1, 10) = (1...9)
