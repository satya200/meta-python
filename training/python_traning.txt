1> Interpreted Technology
2> Loosly typed data
In python data type is decided compile time. And all data type is object and in python all are object

Implicit: i = 20

Explicit: int i; i  = 20
strings are store like arry in python and string are imutable means we can not change

print("-" * 40) ==> Print line

DATA STRUCTURES:
----------------
1> List:
--------
a> same as array. Collectiom of heteroginious data. memory allocation is continues.
b> range operater is used to generate number ramge(1, 10) = (1...9) 
Ex: create list  l = list(range(1, 10))

Deep copy: l2 = l1. l2 should have separete memory and l1 should have separate memory we can write l2 = l1.copy
In case of deep copy for 2D array we are having issue. So we have to go for l2 = l1.copy.deepcopy() we have to import copy

Shallow copy: l2 = l1 both l1 and l2 share same memory changes in one array it ll affect another array

sort will sort orginal list
sorted ll create copy of the sorted list

2> Dict
--------
a> It is called as associative arrays.
d = k1: v1, k2: v2, k3: v3
3> Tuples
---------==
a> a = 1, 2, 3  ==> This is tuple
b = (2, 3, 4)
c = tuple(1, 2, 3)
All tuples are imutable similar as string

comprehension: It is iterating a list using lambda syntaxes
-------------------
a> lambda is a function without name means anonomes function. Best use in map, filter
Ex:
----
def add(a, b)
	reurn a +b
a = add
res = a(100, 200)
l = lambda x, y: x + y
res = l(10, 20)
4> set
