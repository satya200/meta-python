File Handling
-------------
Data in a txt or flat file is stored in ascii format

open function is to open a file

open in read, write and append mode

read - if the file exists, then open the file for reading
       if the file does not exist then exception FileNotFoundError is raised
       if the mode is not mentioned then the file is opened in read mode

FL.read() - reads the entire contents of the file if the bytes are not mentioned
FL.read(50) - reads 50 bytes from the file

FL.readline() - will read one line 

FL.readlines() - can read all the lines from the file

write - if the file exists then it will delete all the file contents and will ready to write
        if the file does not exist then will create the file

append - if the file exists then it will append data to the file contents that already exists
        if the file does not exist then will create the file 

FL_pos = FL.seek(offset, whence)

FL.seek(100, 0)	 => calculate 100 bytes from BOF

FL.seek(50, 1) => calculate 50 bytes from the CP

FL.seek(50, 2) = calculare 50 bytes from EOF

offset = no of bytes
Whence = 0 - BOF
	 1 - CP
	 2 - EOF


FL_pos = FL.tell()

EXCEL file Manipulation
-----------------------
xlrd ...

using openpyxl library to manipulate Excel

Workbook = Excel file

Worksheet = Pages in excel file

A5 = cell address

c10 = cell address

excel sheet = rows-> 1048576
